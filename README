# Preamble
first instruction taken from:
https://github.com/Polidea/cmake-nRF5x
It is constantly changed and improved (or downproved :P)

# IMPORTANT:
This compiler is used to compile:
gcc-arm-none-eabi-8-2018-q4-major

But if you set C++17 then it fails :P You have to manualy patch NordicSDK (15.2)
and upgrade CMSIS to have things working go here
https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5

and download following files which should be placed here:
libarm_cortexM4lf_math.a, libarm_cortexM4l_math.a  ->  nordic_SDK_15.2/components/toolchain/cmsis/dsp/GCC
arm_cortexM4lf_math.lib  arm_cortexM4l_math.lib  ->  nordic_SDK_15.2/components/toolchain/cmsis/dsp/ARM

also copy folder 
CMSIS_5-develop/CMSIS/Core/Include  ->  nordic_SDK_15.2/components/toolchain/cmsis/include

clean & build all should work

# To build & run tests...

This is super-glue solution, so your eyes will bleeed...
It will use host compiler (not cross-compiler) to build host based tests.
It is NOT ment to test all, only most complicated logic. So to have test build and run you have to:

execute 
cmake -D -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
make all

then you can call for example 
./test/time_schedule_tests
