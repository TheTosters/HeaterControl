IMPORTANT:
This compiler is used to compile:

But if you set C++17 then it fails :P You have to manualy patch NordicSDK (15.2)
and upgrade CMSIS to have things working go here
https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5

and download following files which should be placed here:
libarm_cortexM4lf_math.a, libarm_cortexM4l_math.a  ->  nordic_SDK_15.2/components/toolchain/cmsis/dsp/GCC
arm_cortexM4lf_math.lib  arm_cortexM4l_math.lib  ->  nordic_SDK_15.2/components/toolchain/cmsis/dsp/ARM

also copy folder 
CMSIS_5-develop/CMSIS/Core/Include  ->  nordic_SDK_15.2/components/toolchain/cmsis/include

clean & build all should work
